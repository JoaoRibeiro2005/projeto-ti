                <h2>Front-end Dev</h2>
                <img src="/assets/images/image_02.jpg" alt="Image 02">
                <p>Front-end technologies are responsible for everything the user sees and interacts with in a web application, such as layouts, animations, forms, and navigation. They mainly involve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which form the foundation of modern web development. HTML structures the content, CSS defines styling and responsiveness, while JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. In addition, frameworks and libraries such as React, Vue, and Angular optimize development by making code more organized, reusable, and scalable. Front-end development is also closely related to user experience (UX) and responsive design, ensuring fast, accessible applications that work well across different devices and browsers.</p>

                <h2>Back-end Dev</h2>
                <img src="assets/images/backend.png" alt="Image 03">
                <p>Back-end technologies are responsible for the server-side logic of an application, handling data processing, business rules, and communication between the server, database, and front-end. They involve programming languages and frameworks such as Node.js, Java, Python, PHP, and C#, which manage requests, authentication, and application workflows. The back-end also works with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB to store, retrieve, and manipulate data securely and efficiently. In addition, it plays a crucial role in performance, scalability, and security, ensuring that applications can handle multiple users, protect sensitive information, and deliver reliable services through APIs and integrations.</p>

                <h2>Fullstack Dev</h2>
                <img src="assets/images/fullstack.png" alt="Image 04">
                <p>Fullstack development combines both front-end and back-end technologies, enabling a developer to work across the entire application stack. A fullstack developer understands how user interfaces are built using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks, while also managing server-side logic with languages, frameworks, and databases on the back-end. This broad skill set allows fullstack developers to design, develop, and maintain complete web applications, ensuring smooth communication between the client and server. As a result, fullstack development promotes versatility, faster problem-solving, and a holistic view of how different parts of a system work together to deliver a functional and scalable product.</p>

                        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding language. AI technologies include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, which enable applications to analyze large volumes of data, recognize patterns, and make decisions with high accuracy. In addition to its growing impact across industries like healthcare, finance, education, cybersecurity, and software development, the AI field is known for offering highly competitive salaries, driven by strong market demand, the complexity of the skills required, and the strategic importance of AI solutions for modern businesses.</p>

                    <p>Cybersecurity is a technology discipline dedicated to defending digital infrastructures, systems, and information against cyber threats and malicious activity. It covers areas such as system hardening, vulnerability analysis, ethical hacking, encryption, and threat monitoring, helping organizations detect, prevent, and respond to security incidents. As cyber risks continue to grow across sectors like finance, healthcare, government, and technology, cybersecurity professionals are in high demand and often benefit from attractive salaries, reflecting the specialized expertise required and the critical role security plays in protecting data, operations, and organizational reputation.</p>
